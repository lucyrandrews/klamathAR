# Klamath Barriers Map

This repository contains code that creates a simple shiny app for the
visualization of stream barriers in the Klamath River watershed. A user can
select barriers in a point-and-click interface to pull up barrier attributes
relevant to [barrier removal decision-making](https://www.americanrivers.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fact-Sheet-The-Importance-of-Dam-Removal.pdf).

Barrier data comes from [American Rivers](https://www.americanrivers.org/),
who requested this app to quickly see barrier locations and confirm dataset
accuracy with expert evaluation.

[The app can be found here](https://lucyrandrews.shinyapps.io/klamathar/).
Please be patient with it loading - it can take a moment!
